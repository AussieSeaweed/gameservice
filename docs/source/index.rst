GameFrame
=========

GameFrame is a Python package for various game implementations.

The following games are already implemented in GameFrame...

- Tic Tac Toe
- Rock Paper Scissors

In addition, many poker game variants are implemented on `PokerTools <https://pokertools.readthedocs.io/>`_ package.


Speed
-----

Although GameFrame is entirely written in Python, it should be fast enough for many tasks.
